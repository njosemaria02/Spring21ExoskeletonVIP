# Spring21ExoskeletonVIP

This is a compilation of the documents involved in my research with Georgia Tech's EPIC lab during Spring 2021 under their VIP Hip Exoskeleton Team. As part of this team, I worked on the VR game aspect of the project aiming to develop a way of informing human intuition with path planning. My goal was to model the Artificial Potential Field (APF) path planning physics concept in an algorithmic manner. Work is highly passed off of the referenced APF algorithm article and the referenced python code (1, 2).

## Assets
Scripts and metadata used within Unity to replicate this Python APF implementation. Includes scripts used to learn about Unity physics and final semester deliverables.

## Python APF Implementation Screenshots
Several screenshots resulting from the localization of the referenced python code (1) in my local system. Screenshots include personal experimentation with parameters to better understand the functionality.

## Midterm Presentation Demos
Some videos of the Unity scripts found in "Assets" demonstrating some of my research with Unity's physics and coding.

## Final Presention Demos
More videos of the Unity scripts found in "Assets" demonstrating further research and the start of APF implementation in the Unity environment for integration into the team's VR game.
